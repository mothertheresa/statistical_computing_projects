Welcome to my Bloom Filter!

OVERVIEW:
(-) you wonâ€™t really run this, since the content is in the tests
(-) the code is organized into `main` and `test`
(-) `main` includes the `domain` (object definitions, like the `BloomFilter` itself)
(-) `main` also includes `filters` which simply has the `Runner`, which is only a stub
(-) `test` contains the tests and their utility functions

TESTS:
(-) ensure you have Scala and SBT installed
(-) you can view tests in the file `test/scala/filters/Tests`
(-) ensure you are in the director `bloom-filters`
(-) run the file bloom-filter-tests.sh:
./bloom-filter-tests.sh
