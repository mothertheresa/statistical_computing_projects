Welcome to my Tower of Hanoi!

OVERVIEW:
(-) code is organized into `main` and `test`
(-) `main` includes `runner` to run the application from the command line
(-) it also includes `domain` which defines the algorithm and relevant structures
(-) there are two implementations of the tower of hanoi algorithm: iterative and recursive in `TowerOfHanoiIterative` and `TowerOfHanoiRecursive`
(-) there is `TowerOfHanoiUtility` which includes a checking function to ensure valid moves
(-) the `Accumulator` file defines what an accumulator is and pretty printing

TESTS:
(-) ensure you have Scala and SBT installed
(-) run the file run_tests.sh:
./run_tests.sh
