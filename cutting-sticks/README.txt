Welcome to my Cutting Sticks!

OVERVIEW:
(-) code is organized into `main` and `test`
(-) `main` includes `runner` to run the application from the command line
(-) it also includes `domain` which defines the algorithm in `CuttingSticks`

RUN:
(-) you can run this from the command line from within the cutting-sticks-app directory by calling, for example:
sbt run 10 2 4 7

TESTS:
(-) ensure you have Scala and SBT installed
(-) run the file run_tests.sh:
./run_tests.sh
